## What is TypeScript

- extends JS (builds off of it)
- JS might not always be best, static typing can prevent errors like those mixing numbers and strings together...

## Installing Typescript

*Make sure you have NodeJS installed!

1. npm init -y (to create a file in our project)

Install npx tsc with-typescript.ts
