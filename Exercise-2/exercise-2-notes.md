##Exercise 2: Arrays & Tuples

1. Declare an array named subjects containing strings.
2. Declare a tuple named student that contains a string (for the name) and a number (for the age).

==========================================

We will be discussing...

- Object Type Definition
- Avoiding the "any" keyword, as this defeats the purpose of TS in JS
- Tuples


Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Example:
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

Tuples are written with round brackets.
